        #You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:
        #Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
        #The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
        #Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.
        #You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
        
        #Example:
        #Given matrix = [[1, 3, 5, 7], [
            #[9, 11, 13, 15], [17, 19, 21, 23], [25, 27, 29, 31], [33, 35, 37, 39]],
